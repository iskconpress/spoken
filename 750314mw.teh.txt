**Prabhupāda:**
...they assemble together and people are unhappy. [break] They have renounced democracy, eh? Communist?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Well, they have some sort of democracy themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they are dictatorship. Actually, Stalin's dictatorship was going on.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes. It's all dictatorship. Democracy is also a dictatorship, but by election. They elect a fool, and then he can be..., do whatever he wants.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Yes.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
He will try to be as powerful as he can.

**Prabhupāda:**
